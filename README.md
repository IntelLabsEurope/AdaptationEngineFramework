**Adaptation Engine Framework**


This software package is a python framework that allows the adaptation of cloud infrastructure and application based on events captured in a message bus. 
It is a standalone module that interacts with the Openstack API in order to actuate upon the cloud infrastructure.  

The Adaptation Engine Framework is essentially an interface between the individual, decision-making Adaptation Engine sub-engines and both the wider Cloud platform and application. The framework provides methods
of configuration and communication allowing Cloud-enabled applications scope to influence and be influenced by the changes of the state of the infrastructure within which it resides.
